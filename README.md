# orcinus

## Introduction

orcinus is a sine wave synthesizer and sequencer based on [ORCA](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca).
This project is currently under heavy development and pretty much unusable.

## Getting started

If you wish to use orcinus inside of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/emanuelbuholzer/orcinus.git
cd orcinus/desktop/
npm install
npm start
```

If you wish to use orcinus inside your browser, open `index.html` from the root of this project in your browser.
